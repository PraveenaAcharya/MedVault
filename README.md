## 🚀 Overview

**MedVault** is a **Web3-powered** decentralized platform that empowers users to **own, encrypt, and control access to their medical records**. Think of it as your **Health Passport**—where you selectively and securely share prescriptions, test reports, and vaccination records with healthcare providers, employers, or insurers using your crypto wallet.

## 💡 Why MedVault?

- 🔐 **Privacy-First**: Records are encrypted and only accessible to whitelisted entities.
- 💳 **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users authenticate via crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- 🌍 **Borderless & Scalable**: Designed to be useful globally, beyond local systems.
- 📄 **Interoperable**: Share data across clinics, hospitals, and platforms securely.
- 🎯 **Judges Will Love**: It combines health, decentralization, and privacy.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User Login**: Connect wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
2. **Record Upload**:
   - Medical records are **encrypted** on the client side.
   - Encrypted files are uploaded to **IPFS/Filecoin**.
3. **On-chain Metadata**:
   - Smart contracts store metadata + access control rules.
   - Includes: who can access, for how long, purpose, etc.
4. **Permissioned Access**:
   - Doctors/employers request access.
   - User receives a transaction request and **signs to approve**.
5. **Optional Features**:
   - **NFT Badges**: Represent completed treatments, organ donations, health milestones.
   - **ZK-Proofs**: Prove health status without revealing full record.
   - **Emergency Access**: Multisig or pre-approved fallback permissions.
